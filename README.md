This tic-tac-toe game basically follows the official React's [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), with this project bootsrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This was my first foray unto React. To this date, the official React tutorial still amaze me on how the React team was able to introduce React and it's essential lifecycle concepts by building a simple tic-tac-toe game, showing once and for all that it doesn't take months to learn basics of React. 

Aside from completing the tutorial's hands-on guide, the project also implemented the tutorial's _"idea of improvements"_, I quote:
- [x] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [x] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [x] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

Looking back, it looks trivial to add the uncompleted the two unchecked boxes, but I'm sharing this as is. Looking at how well the tutorial introduce React's lifecycle methods, I'm looking forward to [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) version.
